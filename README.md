## 📝 Problem Statement

Traditional input devices (like a mouse or keyboard) can be limiting for users with disabilities or for hands-free applications. This project builds a hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and ML to recognize common gestures (e.g., thumbs up, peace, stop) in real-time via webcam.

---

## 📦 Project Scope

- Detect hand using computer vision
- Extract features from hand landmarks
- Train and evaluate a classification model
- Real-time recognition of gestures via webcam
- Display output or trigger custom actions

## 🧱 Modules Description

### ✅ Image/Video Capture Module
- Captures real-time input from the webcam using OpenCV.

### ✅ Hand Detection & Preprocessing
- Uses MediaPipe or OpenCV to detect hand and extract landmarks.

### ✅ Feature Extraction
- Uses (x, y, z) coordinates of hand landmarks.
- Optional: Calculates angle and distance between fingers.

### ✅ Machine Learning Module
- Models: SVM / Random Forest / CNN (Keras)
- Trained on a custom or public dataset to classify hand gestures.

### ✅ Application Module
- Interface using Flask or Streamlit to show real-time predictions.

---

## 📈 Functional Features

- Real-time gesture recognition.
- Interactive and visual feedback.
- Custom dataset support.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, confusion matrix.

---

## 📊 Dataset

You can use public datasets or build your own by capturing webcam images.

### Public Datasets:
- [Kaggle Leap Gesture Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
- [Jester Dataset by 20BN](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester)

**Example Format:**
```csv
image, label
frame1.jpg, peace
frame2.jpg, thumbs_up
...
```

---

## 💡 Expected Output

- Recognize hand gestures like thumbs up, peace, fist, etc.
- Real-time display of recognized gesture.
- Model accuracy of 85%+ with proper training.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Gesture-controlled UI (e.g., slide navigation, video control)
- Voice feedback for accessibility
- Advanced CNN models or Transformer architectures
- IoT integration (e.g., turn on/off appliances)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how ML and computer vision can enable intuitive, gesture-based interaction. Ideal for use in games, robotics, AR/VR, and assistive technology systems.
